Git Statistics Application

This is a console app (for now) that displays interesting stats about your github repo.

Three ways to use this app right now

1.
    - Dump your log to a file. via 'git log -stat > file.txt'
    - Copy that file to the git pull directory and change the code to point to that file
    - Run the app via 'ruby git_pull.rb'
    - This brings back all the commits
2.
    - Same as above but with multiple names so you can see how well/poor someone is doing on your app.
    - simple run this instead: 'ruby git_pull.rb name1 name2'
3.
    - Navigate to a github repo (or a non github repo)
    - run 'ruby ~/dir_you_put_git_pull/git_pull.rb stats'
    - You will get of all the formats used and how much code is in each file.
    - How many comments, etc
